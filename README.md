# M0MNF's qsoLogger
This is very much DIY software. I'm not a programmer, me, google & chatGPT wrote it so if it's poorly writtren ineffecitent code, you know why!

I wanted a logger for the PicoCalc that I could use when operating out and about. This serves that purpose. When I get home if there's anyone noteworthy in the mobile log, I stick them in my main logbook, please do not use this to replace your main logbook. The software was written by me (not a programmer) the internet (you've been on Reddit right?) and the hive mind (remember chatGPT thinks people with 6 fingers is normal. 

If you're not me, I would assume I've done it wrong and that it will eventually lose the data you put in it (it hasn't lost anyting I've put in it, but it's saving things to a .txt file on an SD card so it's not long term!) and if this is going to make you sad, don't use it. The interface is basic, but it's running on what is essentially an overpowered calculator, and I like it :)

All that having been said, it works for what I want it to do. Over time I'll get it working with the RTC module I have on my desk to remove the manually logging the date / time on first load, but between now and then, it's all good.

If you make any cool changes to it, please share them up here.
