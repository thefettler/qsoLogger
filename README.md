# qsoLogger
Home made software. I'm not a programmer, me, google & chatGPT wrote it so if it's poorly writtren ineffecitent code, you know why!
It works for what I want it to do, over time I'll get it working with an RTC module to remove the logging the date / time on first load, but between now and then, it's all good.
If you make any cool changes to it, please share them up here.
